Dear Sir/Madam,
I noticed your job offer on Linkedin and I thought to apply as:
- I'm very passionate about research, especially machine learning;
- I've got experience as project manager;
- I have been working on Earth Observation. I've recently published a paper on machine learning and Sentinel data, please see my enclosed CV;
- I'm presently working on time series forecasting with respect to a project to analyze how the climate affects the release of pollutants in polar areas.
I would be very interested in discussing further these topics, should you find my CV suitable for your present needs.
Thanks,
Paolo Fazzini.
